What client.py does?
It connects to the server over a socket.
It can send message typed by the user.
It can receive messages from the server.
It uses threads so that it can send and receive at the same time.

What server.py does?
Listens for incoming TCP connections.
Accepts clients and starts a thread for each.
Receives messages from a client.
Broadcasts messages to all other clients.
Handles disconnections cleanly.

What is socket?
A socket is a software endpoint for sending or receiving data across a network.

What is thread?
A thread is a separate flow of execution. Python programs are normally single-threaded: one thing happens at
a time. So we use thread to receive messages in the background. In our code, the main thread waits for the
input and background thread keeps on checking for incoming messages.
